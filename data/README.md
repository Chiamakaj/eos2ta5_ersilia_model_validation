# External Dataset collection

The external dataset was sourced from the direction found in this publication [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01301). This dataset here can be found in ChEMBL database also.
There are contained 13986 molecules. After comparing with the training set from the original model, 5025 molecules were found to be contained in both datasets. These 5025 molecules were removed to avoid bias.
